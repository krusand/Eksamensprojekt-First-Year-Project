# Medical Imaging 
Welcome to our Github repository for our exam project in the First Year Project course.

The project focuses on segmentation, feature extraction and classification of medical images. In particular images of skin lesions. The goal of the project is to train a classifier, which is able to predict whether unknown skin lesions are cancerous or not. 

All of the extracted features can be found in the python file `features.py`.

The image data along with some metadata is provided by Mendeley Data and can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zr7vgbcyr2/.
